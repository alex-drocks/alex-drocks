## Hello, I‚Äôm Alexandre Desroches!

**JS** and **TS** front-end wizard üßôüòÅ &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/JavaScript-logo.png" alt="Javascript Logo" width="20" height="20"/>


My first coding experience was to build an accounting software from scratch. 
It now has 300 daily unique users and is free to use for small businesses in Quebec Canada (https://finance-d.com).
Finance D also ranks organically in top Google Search for specific queries.
All this was accomplished without a team and no marketing.

I expanded on this knowledge to mine on the Bittensor AI network by providing cloud instances that solve specific problems.

Note: In December 2021 I had to start using GitLab for work and so my GitHub activity may have dropped since. This does not reflect my actual time invested coding. In fact, I code even more than before.
