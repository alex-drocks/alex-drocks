## Hello, Iâ€™m Alexandre Desroches!

I really enjoy coding with **JavaScript**&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/JavaScript-logo.png" alt="Javascript Logo" width="20" height="20"/>


### Most of my free time I invest in coding by making:
* websites and web apps with React JS&nbsp;<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/React-icon.svg" alt="React JS Logo" width="24" height="24"/>, 
* and also desktop software with Electron JS&nbsp;<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Electron_Software_Framework_Logo.svg" width="20" height="20"/>.

When it comes to databases, I've been loving Google's Firebase for extremely good free-tier, ease-of-use and fast response times. For now, that's my personnal favorite.

Before fully diving into JavaScript I tried a few other languages like Autohotkey for Windows macroing, Python, Java, C# and PHP.
But, in the end, **JavaScript was the clear winner for me** because it's versatile, efficient, reads well and is omnipresent.
Also, we can do almost anything with it. I think Javascript is an awesome programming language - Thanks to all its contributors!

I like open-source because it's useful to me and to others. Without it, I could not enjoy programming as much as I do now. 
So, as a way to say thank you, I built and maintain an accounting desktop software (made with Javascript) which is completely free to use for small businesses in Quebec Canada. My free accounting software can be downloaded at my website: https://finance-d.com
