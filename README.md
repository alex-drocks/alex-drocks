## Hello, Iâ€™m Alexandre Desroches!

I really enjoy coding with **JavaScript**&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/JavaScript-logo.png" alt="Javascript Logo" width="20" height="20"/>

Mainly, I make websites and web apps with with React JS, and desktop softwares with Electron JS.

Before fully diving into JavaScript I tried a few other languages like Autohotkey for Windows macroing, Python, Java, C# and PHP.
But, in the end, **JavaScript was the clear winner for me.** It's versatile, efficient, reads well and is omnipresent.
Also, we can do almost anything with it. To be honest, I think it's an awesome language - Thanks to all its contributors.
