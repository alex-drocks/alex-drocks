## Hello, I’m Alexandre Desroches!

I like to code with **JS** and **Python** 


My first coding experience was to build an accounting software from scratch. 
It now has 300 daily unique users and is free to use for small businesses in Quebec Canada (https://finance-d.com).
Finance D also ranks organically in top Google Search for specific queries.
All this was accomplished without a team and no marketing.

I expanded on this knowledge to mine on the Bittensor blockchain.


### Feel free to contact me any time on **LinkedIn**, **GitHub**!

Note: In December 2021 I had to start using GitLab for work and so my GitHub activity may have dropped since. This does not reflect my actual time invested coding. In fact, I code even more than before. I also used to have another Github account before this one so activity cutoff on this account does not represent my entire experience.
