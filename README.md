ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @alex-drocks

I really enjoy coding with JavaScript and its vast ecosystem.
My main focus is on vanilla JS, HTML, CSS.

I also work with Electron for desktop apps and React for web apps, but vanilla JS is where I have put most of my efforts as it is a really strong foundation for everything else.

Before discovering JavaScript I tried a few other languages like Autohotkey for Windows macroing, Python, Java, C# and PHP.
JavaScript was the clear winner for me. Its versatile, efficient, reads well and is omnipresent on the web.
You can do almost anything with it and its here to stay!
